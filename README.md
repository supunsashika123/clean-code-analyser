# Clean Code Analyser
A package which analyses the JavaScript code against the Clean Code concepts.

Code is clean if it can be understood easily â€“ by everyone on the team. Clean code can be read and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. With understandability comes readability, changeability, extensibility and maintainability.

Here is an awesome [gist](https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29) about Clean Code concepts.

This library is only focused on Vanilla JS and basic validations.

#### Rules
